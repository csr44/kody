These are some of my school projects. 

In the field of cryptology were created ciphers ADFGVX, PLAYFAIR a RSA and digital signature (Python & PyQt).

Matlab project deals with optimization of parameters: rezistivity, inductance and capacitance of equivalent models of passive components used in EMI (electromagnetic interference) filters, such as resistor, coil and capacitor for certain frequency range. Three algorythms were used: Genetic algorythm linear and logarithmic, Particle Swarm. For successful optimization is needed file for configuration of optimization, "cost" function witch provide suitability of a particular solution and impedance function to recalculate the substituted values (R, L, C, fr.).

Automatic positioning system to follow sun was created using two DC 24 V linear motors, relay module, Raspberry Pi, camera 5Mpx 160°. The control unit was programmed using Python, library Numpy and OpenCV. The system was also controlled through an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and calculated values of the position of the sun, which was not successful, due to the fact, that the motors operate without feedback.
